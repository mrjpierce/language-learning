Memorization, Part 2 - Jan 12

Hello again language learners! If you haven't already please read Memorization, Part 1.

As detailed in part 1, it's imperative we make the knowledge we want to memorize important. This assures it passes our memory's filter process and moves into long term memory. Knowledge is more important to us and therefor "sticks" best when it is tied to knowledge already in long term memory. Even more so if this long term knowledge is personal and intimate to us and again even more so if it attaches itself to the more primal of our emotions.

We need to link this personal intimate knowledge with the new piece of information. We do this by recalling from long term memory that which we can associate with this new bit of information. While recalling these memories and processing the new information at the same time, the two get tangled. We are building connections between that which we understand and that which we wish to understand.

While doing this it is best we allow ourselves to become very aware of all our senses. We must be wistful in our musings, but focused on actualizing the feelings and sensations we produce.  This is best shown by example. Let's together learn the Japanese word for "dog" to demonstrate how this works in practice. 	

犬

Without getting too into the Japanese language itself, this character represents the idea that we in English would use the word "dog" to describe. While reading this sentence you probably already forgot what it looked like. You probably just glanced at it again. This is understandable. That symbol means nothing to you. You have no knowledge that could possibly link those 4 strokes of ink (or pixels as it were) to the idea "dog". We have already activated our sense of sight. Let's activate two other senses.

犬
"inu" (pronounced ee-new)

This is how you spell the Japanese character for the idea that is "dog". If you say it out loud, you now activated auditory senses as well as the tactile feeling of your mouth making the correct shapes and your vocal cords activating. Now you might be thinking, "Great! But James I now just have more information that means nothing to me". Here is where the magic happens.

Soft focus your eyes into empty space. Recall a fond memory with a dog, maybe one you had as a kid, if you never had a dog, maybe one of a breed that you really like, make it as personal as you can. Remain, softly focused, glance at the character and pronounce its name.

犬
"inu"

We can do better, let's turn these thoughts into a short mental movie. Whenever, the character 犬 appears, say it out loud.

  Call to your dog, see its happy face, 犬 "inu". Hear the rattling of its collar as its runs over to you wagging its tail. Give it a hug, 犬 "inu". Feel its fur, smell its dog food breath. 犬 "inu". Oh my goodness he licked your face and he accidentally licked the inside of your mouth, BLEH, 犬! A man kicks open your door, the wood splintered everywhere, your 犬 defends you and barks and snarls at the intruder, 犬! The man has a red hot brand in the shape of the Japanese word for 犬! He pushes it into your dogs forehead! No!!! My Poor 犬! The man leaves and you hold your whimpering 犬, looking at the burn mark, √ you kiss his forehead better.

Okay, I think I've made my point. Now before you get mad at me hurting your imaginary... What word came to mind just then? Close your eyes, can you see it? I'd bet you can. I bet its still ringing in your ears. Why? We have successfully used strong imagery to tie new knowledge to old knowledge, marking it as important enough to enter semi-long term memory. We activated our senses. Our real world senses (sight of the word), tactile (our mouth and vocal cords when we say the word "inu"), and our imaginary senses, maybe better described as "sensory memories". The feel of the fur, the smell of dog breath, the taste of its dog food lick, the sound of its bark and whimpering. We enhanced this process with emotional attachment and general intense emotion. Lastly we used our human proclivity to prioritize information that to us is either disgusting, violent, or arousing. The more bombastic the sense the more useful to us it is. We have hacked our own system into remembering... Can you still see it? How about say it or hear it? Don't worry if its faded, or difficult. Generating these scenes and living in them is a skill you get better at. It might take a ton of effort to remember to feel the fur or smell the breath, but it will become more automatic. 

One more part to go, we will wrap up this topic, discussing both what we already have learned and who to make sure we will always know the word 犬. See you in part 3!
