language-learning

This is a collection of thoughts and musings on learning new languages. These small writings provide a good base of understanding and some resources to help get you started on the journey. The articles were originally meant for a private audience of like minded work colleagues, but I believe there to be a wider use for these words. Save for the memorization series I did in January they do not have to be read in any particular order.

Enjoy,
