Framing Language Learning Correctly - Aug 5

It's been a while since I wrote an article on language learning. I've had increased responsibility as of late, but make no mistake I am still on my habit of daily language learning! We remain 30 strong in this channel at time of writing which is fantastic. I started this channel to create a space where we could learn from each other. Language learning is esoteric. It seems most know what they are supposed to be doing, but like so many things, knowing what to do is a small piece of the puzzle. The real obstacles to achievement are 50% figuring out how  to do what we need to and 50% executing on that how. Everything else is minutia. Language learners often lose sight of their ultimate goal by keeping their noses too close to the grindstone. It's helpful to understand exactly what we are trying to accomplish.

Language learning is difficult because it requires deep work, which requires prolonged concentration and a minimization of distraction, but also shallow work, which requires prolonged exposure to sounds symbols and structure. There is no way to "cram" on a language like many of us did for tests in college. A new language requires imprinting the characteristics of the language upon our brain. 

We better understand the process of language learning if we frame it correctly. It is incorrect, that it is an effort in memorization. We understand it as such because the first thing we are asked to do is to store tons of vocabulary somewhere in our gray-matter.  Yet this is only a "how", for which we never learn the "what" or "why". In other words, what is vocabulary memorization attempting to accomplish. The problem with following planned or structured lessons/programs is we are never taught why we are doing certain activities. Even more detrimental, when these techniques fail or become ineffectual we are left with no recourse or remedy.

To understand what we need to accomplish with a new language lets understand what we have accomplished in an already acquired language. In all of us, lies a grand pattern matching machine for the English Language. This pattern machine can not only decode English into ideas, it can encode thoughts into English. This two way machine allows us to communicate effortlessly in English without much conscious thought. When we seek to learn a new language we seek to build another language learning machine which can decode and encode a new type of data. While memorizing 40,000 new words and an almost infinite number of sentence structures remains out of the grasp of most people, building such a machine that can decode 40,000 words and almost every sentence it encounters is more than doable. We just require enough input to train the machine!

When we frame the tool of Vocabulary Memorization within the idea that it should help train our machine, we better understand its purpose and place it has in our language learning toolbox. We need to feed our new pattern machine information to train it. Learning vocabulary, just like practicing sentences, is just that. We teach it about new sounds, new symbols, and new structures. We teach it about whats correct and whats not and we do so via increased exposure to these new patterns. The end goal being that after training our pattern machine enough, it can start to encode and decode data we haven't even trained it to. It can encode and decode entirely new and unique data! This is how we learn a new language without learning every single sentence that will ever be said and how we passively acquire new vocabulary. This is how we become fluent.
