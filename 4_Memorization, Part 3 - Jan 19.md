Memorization, Part 3 - Jan 19

Good morning Learners, today we continue our series on memorization.

In the first part I introduced the idea of "importance" and the role it plays in us retaining knowledge. In the second part we looked at a very powerful way to assure a new word in a foreign language is "labeled" important enough to lodge itself in semi-long term memory. In part 3 we will go over how to make sure this new knowledge stays in long term memory for decades, if not the remainder of our lives.

First off though, do you still remember the Japanese word for dog? What if we look at the character?

It's okay if you don't. Don't throw up your hands and proclaim, "If this special technique didn't work then I will never learn a new language!" We left out a key component we will cover today, that of reinforcement!

Once we have successfully hooked our new bit of knowledge into our semi-long term memory we have won our hardest fought battle!  
Although we should be excited, our victory is fleeting. This new knowledge is but a papers weight upon the neurons in our brain. We must give it weight! We must give it reinforcement. 

Science shows us that the best way to retain a bit of information longer, is to attempt to recall it just as its about to leave our memory. For this reason, we time our reviews at certain intervals which exponentially grow longer. The act should be slightly strenuous, if you have that tip-of-the-tongue feeling and eventually recall the information, you are right on the money and every time we are right on the money it stays in our long-term memory longer. An average review schedule for a bit of information would look (abet not exactly) as follows 10 seconds, 10 minutes, 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, 24 days, 90 days, 270 days, 3 years, 10 years. That last number should be encouraging. It should be noted that this schedule assumes we do not recall the information at all between reviews. As it applies to language, we will be on even better footing as we begin to actually use our language and continuously recall our vocabulary as we begin speaking, listening, writing, and reading!

Now this might seem like quite a pain to keep track of. Thankfully the science supported technique I have just described has only gotten more popular in the past decade and now we have a range of software solutions to choose from that use what we formally call "Spaced Repetition Systems" or SRS for short. These solutions, using algorithms, attempt to predict when the bit of knowledge will start to slip your memory and schedules a review on that day! Effortless!

There are many tools out there, but my favorite remains the venerable Anki (https://apps.ankiweb.net/). While not the most user friendly solution it is available on every platform imaginable, flexible, configurable, syncable between devices, and entirely free. If Anki doesn't float your boat there are many other options, most flashcard software have implemented a flavor of SRS into their feature set.

I thought I was going to be able to wrap up this topic in this post, but looks like we have another one to go. See you in part 4!
