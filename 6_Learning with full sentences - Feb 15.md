Learning with full sentences - Feb 15

While reviewing single words in isolation makes for quick vocabulary acquisition in the beginning we favor learning with full sentences as soon as we can. That is, as soon as we understand a bit of grammar.

Sentences of which we understand every word except the target word have built in context and as we have covered, context is not only the best way we understand new knowledge, it's the only way. Without context we can acquire no new knowledge. Therefore it makes sense we give ourselves as much innate context as possible.

Let's look a sentence in English:

"The boy hit the ball with the _"

If we imagine we are learning English and understand every other word in this sentence. Even without knowing the word "bat" we have huge amounts of context this sentence helps us dredge up from our memory. We can visualize the object, all that is required is to hook all of this context with the word we want to learn, "bat".

A sentence with a word missing for the purposes of recollection is commonly called a "cloze". We can create cloze flashcards almost from the beginning of our language journey. Even if we don't many the words in a given sentence we can create multiple different flashcards, each with a different word missing. Over time we not only memorize the words and understand their meaning, we also understand how one would use each word and how to construct a valid sentence. These are dividends to our learning investment!
