Vocabulary - March 3rd 

So far we have covered how to memorize vocabulary. This is the most important part of learning a new language and there are no shortcuts beyond assuring we require as few re-reviews and retain as much as possible.

With a big vocabulary, even with no knowledge of the grammar rules, we can understand and be understood. Therefore it is better to focus on vocabulary over grammar in the beginning.

It is more useful to be able to say:  
"Yesterday, I eat hamburger cold."

Than it is to know the pattern:  
"Yesterday, {Subject pronoun} {past-tense verb} {article} {adjective} {object noun}"

And not be able to have the vocabulary to use it!
"Yesterday, I ate a cold hamburger"

Whenever I get burned out, confused, frustrated, or just need to put a language on the shelf for a while I make sure to continue daily review of vocabulary and tossing in new words from a high frequency list*. This allows me to continue my word acquisition with extremely little effort. This is powerful. No matter how fast we learn our vocabulary it will naturally take a while for the vocabulary to become instantly recallable. Even if we somehow memorized 1,000 words in a day, we have not formed many deep connections with these words that form naturally as these words mingle with the rest of our knowledge (contexts).

In our next article we move on to grammar.

* Frequency lists are lists of words ordered by appearance frequency in one or more texts. Frequency lists are useful for choosing which words to spend time on first, by assessing how often that word is used.
