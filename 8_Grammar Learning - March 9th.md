Grammar Learning - March 9th

Happy Tuesday learners! Today we talk about the elusive and mysterious act of grammar acquisition!

How does one acquire grammar rules? I am a firm believer that memorizing grammar rules from a text book will only give you a facsimile of understanding. Grammar is best learned naturally via exposure, but when we talk about "learning grammar" what we are actually talking about is forming intuition about sentence structure. 

There is a very good reason why you know that "The cold hamburger" is correct grammar and "The hamburger cold" is not. Without even knowing the English rule that dictates adjectives come before nouns, we can still form sentence correctly. One version of the sentence *feels* correct.

When we learn grammar in a new language our goal is to build this intuition; To understand what *feels* like the correct way to build a sentence and therefore do it effortlessly.

The almost mystical language machine we all have in our heads allows us to accomplish this simply with prolonged exposure to our target language. The more we read and listen to the more our human brains, evolved with very astute pattern finding ability, can naturally build intuition about sentence structure.

It is the repeated occurrence of grammar rules, like wagon wheels over stone, that will form ruts and divots with which we guide our own wheels through the process of intuited sentence creation. It happens somewhere between the conscious and sub-conscious, and in spontaneous bursts, but ultimately it is something that cannot be studied. Like reading about golf swing technique, only through the act of doing do we gain a full and useable understanding and skill.
