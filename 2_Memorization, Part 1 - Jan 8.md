Memorization, Part 1 - Jan 8

Good morning language learners. Today I want to talk about memorization. A lot of people (myself included) conclude very early on that language learning was simply not for them after spending a few days with vocabulary and finding these new words enter one ear and fall out the other. What they fail to understand is that retaining knowledge, or rather, techniques that enable knowledge retention can be learned and improved. Put more simply, we can learn how to remember, how to hack our biological processes and tell our brains “this is important, remember this”. In fact I have just touched upon the key element in which our techniques will be based, that of “importance”. Our brains process enormous amounts of data every second of every day. It automatically retains that which it deems important to us and our survival and discards the rest. Knowing this it is easy to understand what we must do to remember our vocabulary. We must assure each piece of our language knowledge passes our “important” filter and lodges itself deep within our long term memory. We do this by forming connections. The more connections the better.
Think of that bit of knowledge you are attempting to memorize as a ballon. When attempting to memorize the word you are holding that balloons string. You look at the word, you hear its sounds, but it doesn’t connect to anything you know. When you stop studying, you unclench your hand and what does the balloon do? It floats away! Connections to other things in your mind are like roping anchors to that balloon. All knowledge you currently possess can be used to anchor new knowledge, tying ropes to your balloon so when you let go, the balloon stays in place. The more ropes the better! The more ties to your current knowledge the easier that bit of information is to recall.

In part 2 we will detail techniques to accomplish this and my personal process you can use as a foundation for your own.
