Memorization, Part 4 - Jan 27

Good morning learners. Today we will cap off the memorization series with a few more helpful tips, some new techniques, and how we can pull this all together to learn and retain our vocabulary quickly and effectively.

Let us return to this idea of information "importance". Remember how we weaved a story around our poor çŠ¬? What we were really doing is building "context" where there was none. Context is important, its how we learn a lot of our target language. It allows us to infer meaning of that which is not known by using what we do know. Context is powerful, so powerful in fact that you will reach a point in your language journey when you may continue progressing using context alone. There are even certain things in your target language that you can ONLY learn through context.

So, what is context? Context is information we already understand that can be used to understand a new piece of information. Everything we currently understand we understand because of a grand hierarchy of previous understanding. Now before we get too Derridean and post-modernist, let me say that these hierarchies are entirely personal and therefore will be useful to different degrees when attempting to add to that hierarchy. Said another way, each word will take different efforts to memorize for different people.

While building a complex scene is great for words that have proven difficult for us personally, its usually unnecessary for each and every word we wish to learn. Learning a language requires a large vocabulary acquisition and we must assure we use our time and effort wisely. The below is how I handle most of my words, especially in a language such as Italian where a lot of words are close to their English equivalents and are naturally "sticky" for the English speaker.

First, I make sure to still activate all my senses. I say it out loud, I hear myself saying it, I feel what it feels like for my mouth and tongue to say the word. I turn the word over in my brain, look at the shape of the word, say the word with different emotions. We call this "Romancing the word". We play with the word. If we already know enough of our target language to do so, we can think up a sentence to use the word in.

At this stage ill attempt to dredge up memories to associate with the word. If its a noun ill manipulate that object in my mind. I've even mimed eating a strawberry while trying to remember what one tastes like and repeating the word in Italian "fragola" (strawberry). You might look foolish, but you will remember. This at speed should take no more than 5-10 seconds and will naturally be easier as you practice. 

If you do the above and through your reviews you are finding it just isn't sticking, its time to roll up our sleeves. Its most likely a good investment of our time to build ridiculous scenes and live in them as we learned how to do in Memorization Part 2.  If the word represents a feeling or something abstract and hard to express its most likely you will skip to this stage.  

Finally, if you have tried everything and its just not sticking, set it aside for a while. Its not worth getting burned out over 1 word. Most likely, after you gain in proficiency in your target language, you can return to it and find it much easier to retain. And why would that be? We will have more context! Never forget that context is king!

Its important we only use as much effort as needed for each word and we only know how much effort is required after spending time with each word. After all, we have thousands of words to memorize.

Hopefully by now you are beginning to understand why the traditional rote memorization we all did in school is ineffective and a waste of time. Memorization requires consciousness, remaining present, and activating your brain. As cognitive phycologist Daniel Willingham once said, "Memory is the residue of thought." And without thought, without deeply thinking about that which we want to learn, there can be no impression, no residue, and no chance for retention.

I hope you have found this series of articles helpful. They are to be considered "primers" or "Cliffs notes" versions of very complex ideas, but should be enough to get you started in the right direction!
